Here are the instructions for how to play Blackjack
1. Blackjack is a game of skill and luck. Your goal is to draw cards from a deck until you reach the value of 21.
Each card has a value equal to the number on the card with the exception of the Ace, Jack, Queen and King.
For the Jack, Queen and King, they have a value of 10. For the Ace, it has a value of 1 or 11,
depending if your total hand value would go over 21. For example, if you draw Two of Hearts and 
Ace of Spades, your hand would have a value of a soft 13, "soft" indicating that your Ace is valued as 11.
At the beginning a round, you place your bets, and the dealer and you are both dealt two cards,
with one card from the dealer hidden. You may "hit" to draw a card, or "stand" if you are
satisfied with your current hand. If your hand totals 21, you have a Blackjack.
You win that round unless the dealer too has a Blackjack. If your hand goes above 21, 
you bust, and you lose regardless of whether the dealer busts. Otherwise, you compare
your value with the dealer, and the higher value wins. On the occasion where both parties
have the same value, you "push", meaning no one wins nor loses.
You may also double down during the start of the round, betting up to 100% of your original
bet, but drawing only one extra card. If you draw two cards with the same value, you may
bet the same value you bet originally and "split", splitting the cards into two hands,
then playing on each hand seperately.

You may only split once per pair. The dealer must hit until they reach a 17,
and the game ends when there are less than 10 cards left in the deck.
